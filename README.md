# EDSR-Super-Resolution
This repository is an implementation of EDSR model implemented in PyTorch

This model was trained on NVIDIA P100 with ~4500 annotated satellite Low Resolution image pathches which were obtained by Image degradation and Image downsampling of the High Resolution images. You can download the dataset which I used for training the model [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dbqh0lo5YAKhuPBXOlcUGsew5pL0T33O?usp=sharing)
